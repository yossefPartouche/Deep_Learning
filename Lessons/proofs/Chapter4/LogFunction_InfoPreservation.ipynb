    "This is a proof that's taught early on in most mathematics curricula and can reasonably be assumed as prior knowledge for many readers. <br>\n",
    "However, since this function arises repeatedly across mathematics, probability and machine learning, it's useful to have the argument written down explicitely. <br>\n",
    "Additionally, it serves as a clear example of what it means (in a mathematical sense) for a transformation to preserve information, that is for no information to be lost.\n",
