    "\n",
    "Consider a network where we add the result of the processing in the residual block back to the input. Since each branch has some variability, together the overall variance can increase. With ReLU activations and He initialisation, the expected variance is unchanged by the processing in each block, which means that in the next connection the variance increases once more and so on and so forth. Note this idea also applies in the backpropagatio algorithm. \n",
